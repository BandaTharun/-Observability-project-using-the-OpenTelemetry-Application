Excited to share that I've successfully completed an Observability project using the OpenTelemetry Application! 🚀

Which is designed to demonstrate observability concepts in a microservices-based environment. The project highlights the practical implementation of distributed tracing, metrics, and logs using OpenTelemetry.

🔧 Key Learnings & Technical Insights:

Distributed Tracing: Deployed the demo app to observe how requests propagate through multiple services, gaining insights into the causal relationships between different system components.

Metrics & Logs: Gained experience in monitoring and interpreting metrics and logs. The project demonstrated how metrics, such as request rates and error rates, can be utilized to ensure system reliability.

Context Propagation: Explored context propagation to enable tracing across distributed services, crucial for correlating signals across different components and ensuring effective observability.

OpenTelemetry Collector: Configured the OpenTelemetry Collector for data aggregation and export, with a focus on monitoring data flow, handling ingress/egress metrics, and utilizing various processors and exporters.
 
🛠 Tools Used:
* OpenTelemetry SDKs for multiple programming languages
* OpenTelemetry Collector for data aggregation and export
* Prometheus for metrics scraping and visualization
* Jaeger for distributed tracing and visualization
* Grafana for analyzing, monitoring, and visualizing telemetry from diverse data sources
* Loadgen for performance testing, load testing, and functionality testing.
* Docker & Kubernetes for deployment and orchestration

## Welcome to the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop Demo

This repository contains the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop, a microservice-based
distributed system intended to illustrate the implementation of OpenTelemetry in
a near real-world environment.

Our goals are threefold:

- Provide a realistic example of a distributed system that can be used to
  demonstrate OpenTelemetry instrumentation and observability.
- Build a base for vendors, tooling authors, and others to extend and
  demonstrate their OpenTelemetry integrations.
- Create a living example for OpenTelemetry contributors to use for testing new
  versions of the API, SDK, and other components or enhancements.
